During the first week, I learned the basics of coding. It was intersting because, I am no stranger to research being a psychology major however, coding seemed almost foriegn to me.  I constanly needed assitance from my peers luckily I met some very intelligent people who assited me thorughtout this week. I found that coding may be tedious but wasn't the hardest thing I had to do. It seemed like a struggle and I was in for an expirience this summer of hardships. However, surrounding myself around like minded people has led me to persevere thoguht this expirience. I used Google Colab for the first time. A coding software that help me to gain the basic knowledge of coding. And although difficult navigating at first I find myself liking coding a bit more day by day.
