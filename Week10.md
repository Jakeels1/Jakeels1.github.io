Week 10 the conclusion of our Summer AI Research insitute. Through 10 long gruesome 40 hour weeks all of the hard work, dedication, practice, and style shows this tuesday at presentation time. We present our project about trustworthy AI. Coming into this intership my knowledge on trustworthy AI was quite minimal but through this intership my knowledge has grown tremendously and I am forever greatful.
