We created a corpus that includes 10 new intents and 12 utterances. We worked on our chatbot accuracy and precision testing on our intents and utterances. COmparing our 3 frameworks we tested IBM, DialogFlow, and Botpress and noticed high accuracy between the 3. We created a summary of our framework and recorded two 60 second Elevator pitches.
