This week I chose and built two chatbots, IBM Watson and Landbot.io. I chose multiple questions that help to shape my chatbots with information on trustworthy AI.The information was gathered from the three literature reviews I collected about trustworthy AI. My three literature reviews were How to achieve trustworthy artificial intelligence for health, Recent Advances in Trustworthy Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Status, Challenges, and Perspectives,and Artificial intelligence by any other name: a brief history of the conceptualization of “trustworthy artificial intelligence”. Choosing these three sources were the bases of my information. We plug the three literature reviews into an google spreedsheet and collected information on the three literature reviews chosen. After that I trained my model in IBM Watson naming it "Doug the Assistant" and training on trustworthy AI.
