This week I refined my chatbot through IBM Watson. Through reading the documentation I was able to fully grasp the inner workings of IBM Watson and, what it had to offer. I created a step by step cirriculum to help assist users in not only creating an account in IBM Watson but also creating their very own chatbot. After the research I conducted during week 2 for my three literature reviews I took that information and composed it into a one page paper. The challenges I faced were the tedious process of reading though documentation. It became quite the hassle but paid off in the long run.
